# Checkout Page Redesign

1. **Revamp customer info form**  

- Keep the existing inputs but restyle to match the provided reference (stacked labels, lighter cards, spacing tweaks).  
- Use `react-country-region-selector` (`CountryDropdown`, `RegionDropdown`) for Country/State with the same props already demonstrated in `CheckoutPage.tsx`.  
- Ensure initial values still hydrate from `ApiService.getProfile()` / `getUserData()` for first name, last name, phone, email, and address fields.

2. **Add shipping method selector with animation**  

- After the client info block, insert a collapsible/animated section (e.g., CSS transition using `max-height` + `aria-expanded`) titled “Shipping method”.  
- List the four USPS options provided, each showing label, ETA, and price.  
- Automatically enable the “If order $99+…” option only when `total >= 99`, highlight it when eligible, and re-calc shipping charge to 0 when selected.  
- Store the chosen method in state so the order summary updates in real time.

3. **Sync order summary totals**  

- Update the summary panel to display a Shipping row that reflects the selected method (either `$X.XX` or “Complimentary”).  
- Adjust the Total calculation to include the new shipping fee.

4. **Streamline payment section**  

- Remove radio buttons; keep a single static card titled “Payment” describing the bank transfer instructions (translated copy).  
- Ensure `paymentMethod` in component state/order payload is hardcoded to `'bank_transfer'`.

5. **Misc cleanup**  

- Strip debug console logs that aren’t needed for production.  
- Verify no unused handlers/styles remain after the redesign.

### To-dos

- [ ] Restrict paymentMethod state to bank transfer
- [ ] Remove payment radios and keep one payment block
- [ ] Scan Checkout page for unused code/props
